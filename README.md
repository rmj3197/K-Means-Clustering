# K-Means-Clustering
1. Implement a strategy (STRATEGY – 1) in which the initial centroids are picked up randomly from the given dataset 2. Implement a strategy (STRATEGY – 2) in which the first centroid is picked up randomly, for the ith centroid (i>1) a data sample is chosen among all possible data samples such that the mean distance of this chosen sample to all previous (i-1) centers is maximum 3. Implement STRATEGY -1 and STRATEGY -2 for K=2 to 10 4. Calculate the objective function ΣΣ||𝑥−μ||𝑥∈D𝑘𝑖=12 for K= 2 to K=10. 5. Plot the values of objective function (WCSS) vs number of clusters (K)
